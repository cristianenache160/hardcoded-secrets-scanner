# Hardcoded Secrets Scanner

This repository demonstrates a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

The pipeline automatically scans the repository for hardcoded secrets
(e.g., passwords, API keys, tokens) when code is pushed.

The project illustrates basic DevSecOps principles by integrating
automated security checks into the CI process.
